        <h1>Major Telescope Types</h1>
<h2>Refractors</h2>
<p>Refractors are the earliest types of telescopes.
They use a lens as its objective to form an image.
The refracting telescope design was originally used in spy glasses and astronomical telescopes
but is also used for long-focus camera lenses.
Although large refracting telescopes were very popular in the second half of the 19th century, for most
research purposes, the refracting telescope has been replaced by the reflecting telescope.

<h2>Reflectors</h2>
<p>A reflecting telescope (also called a reflector) is a telescope that uses a single or a combination of curved mirrors that reflect light and form an image. 
The reflecting telescope was invented in the 17th century by Isaac Newton as an alternative to the refracting
. Compared to refractors, reflecting telescopes have more magnifying power and can be cheaper to build.
<h2>Catadioptric</h2>
</p>A catadioptric optical system is one where refraction and reflection are combined in an optical system, usually via lenses (dioptrics) and curved mirrors (catoptrics).
Catadioptric combinations are used in focusing systems such as searchlights, headlamps, early lighthouse focusing systems, optical telescopes, microscopes, and telephoto lenses.
They have been used since the 1820s, and are relatively cheap to build.<p/>
